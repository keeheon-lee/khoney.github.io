Thank you for visiting my website. I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Government at Georgetown University. My research lies at the intersection of international and comparative political economy, with a regional focus on Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia. My broader research agenda centers on global supply chain regulation, transnational corporate governance, state–business relations, and energy and environmental politics.

My dissertation examines how public actors in commodity-producing countries in the Global South respond to Western-led public and private sustainability regulations under changing political conditions. Using Indonesia’s palm oil sector as the primary case study, I employ both quantitative and qualitative methods to address this research question.

Prior to beginning my Ph.D. program at Georgetown, I earned a B.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 2020 and served in the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) from 2021 to 2022. I also hold an M.A. in Government (en route to the Ph.D.), awarded by Georgetown University in 2025.
